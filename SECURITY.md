## Security Best Practices for Deploying on Streamlit

To ensure the security of your deployed Streamlit application:

1. **Protect sensitive data**:
   - Use environment variables to store API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive information.
   - Avoid hardcoding credentials in your codebase.
   - Add a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file to securely store sensitive data (if using Streamlit Cloud).

2. **Restrict access**:
   - Use authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, Basic Authentication) to control access to the application.
   - Streamlit Cloud offers built-in options to limit access to authenticated users.

3. **Validate inputs**:
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
   - Use libraries like `pydantic` or `marshmallow` for input validation.

4. **Use HTTPS**:
   - Ensure your application is served over HTTPS, especially when deployed in production.
   - If deploying on Streamlit Cloud, HTTPS is provided by default.

5. **Keep dependencies updated**:
   - Regularly update Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.
   - Use tools like `pip-audit` or `safety` to identify and fix vulnerabilities in dependencies.

6. **Monitor logs**:
   - Enable logging in your application to monitor for unusual activity.
   - Avoid logging sensitive information such as passwords or tokens.
